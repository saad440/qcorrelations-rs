# qcorrelations-rs
Computational library to analyse the dynamics of quantum correlations, written in Rust.  
It currently focuses on measures computed by distance minimization over some set of states for which an analytical solution may not necessarily be available. Multiple threads are used to accelerate the minimization.

Warning: This is a work in progress and not thoroughly tested. There might be glitches and behaviour might drastically change as it is updated.
